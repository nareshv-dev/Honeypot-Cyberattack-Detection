## üîç Overview  
This project implements a **smart AI-powered honeypot** to detect and analyze cyberattacks. The system captures information about attackers, including **IP addresses, attack patterns, and behavior analysis**, while leveraging **machine learning** to classify different types of cyber threats.  

By deploying an interactive honeypot, the project aims to **deceive attackers, collect valuable threat intelligence, and improve overall cybersecurity**.  

## üöÄ Features  
- **Honeypot Setup**: Deploys a trap system to lure attackers and log malicious activities.  
- **AI-Based Attack Classification**: Uses machine learning to detect and classify cyber threats.  
- **Threat Intelligence**: Captures attacker details such as IP addresses, request patterns, and payloads.  
- **Real-time Logging & Alerts**: Notifies security teams of suspicious activities.  
- **Report Generation**: Creates analytical reports on detected cyberattacks.



## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Scapy, PyShark, Pandas, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised and Unsupervised models for attack classification  
- **Storage**: Secure logging system for attack records  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib & Streamlit dashboards for monitoring attacks
